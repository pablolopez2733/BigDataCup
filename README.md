# Big Data Cup
https://github.com/bigdatacup/Big-Data-Cup-2021

## To do:

1- study xT/data_prep.R 
	- Review assumptions, labelling

2- study xT/xt.py <- module / model
	- Assumptions what is a move actions

3- brainstrom think about diff model/improve model
	- implementing exo variables such time/score/# skaters
	
	- modeling defensive actions (similar to xT but using defensive actions instead of moving actions)  

5 - EDA; ways to get insight using our xT model or other models


-----
Adrian: 
1- work on the transition matrix GIF 
2- add nxT to the module do step 5
3 - do step 3

-----
grid search W and L: hyperparameters


Last push (02/11/21):
- Added a column that assigns each event to a cell in a 16 X 12 grid. **See data_wrangling.R**

Last push (02/10/21):
- analyzed xT code from socceraction. **Refer to dissecting_xT.ipynb**

Last push (02/09/21):
- Uploaded ready to use soccer data ("exploring-soccer-models\data-fifa").
- No need to run or read "loading-preparing-soccer_data.ipynb"
- Please read and run "xT-soccer-example.ipynb"; left many comments and observations.
